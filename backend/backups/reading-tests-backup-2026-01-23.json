But what can ski resort owners do if the snow doesn't come?</em></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>A</strong> In the early to mid-twentieth century, with the growing popularity of skiing, ski slopes became extremely profitable businesses. But ski resort owners were completely dependent on the weather: if it didn't snow, or didn’t snow enough, they had to close everything down. Fortunately, a device called the snow gun can now provide snow whenever it is needed. These days such machines are standard equipment in the vast majority of ski resorts around the world, making it possible for many resorts to stay open for months or more a year.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>B</strong> Snow formed by natural weather systems comes from water vapour in the atmosphere. The water vapour condenses into droplets, forming clouds. If the temperature is sufficiently low, the water droplets freeze into tiny ice crystals. More water particles then condense onto the crystal and join with it to form a snowflake. As the snow flake grows heavier, it falls towards the Earth.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>C</strong> The snow gun works very differently from a natural weather system, but it accomplishes exactly the same thing. The device basically works by combining water and air. Two different hoses are attached to the gun. one leading from a water pumping station which pumps water up from a lake or reservoir, and the other leading from an air compressor. When the compressed air passes through the hose into the gun. it atomises the water - that is, it disrupts the stream so that the water splits up into tiny droplets. The droplets are then blown out of the gun and if the outside temperature is below 0°C, ice crystals will form, and will then make snowflakes in the same way as natural snow.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>D</strong> Snow-makers often talk about dry snow and wet snow. Dry snow has a relatively low amount of water, so it is very light and powdery. This type of snow is excellent for skiing because skis glide over it easily without getting stuck in wet slush. One of the advantages of using a snow-maker is that this powdery snow can be produced to give the ski slopes a level surface. However, on slopes which receive heavy use, resort owners also use denser, wet snow underneath the dry snow. Many resorts build up the snow depth this way once or twice a year, and then regularly coat the trails with a layer of dry snow throughout the winter.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>E</strong> The wetness of snow is dependent on the temperature and humidity outside, as well as the size of the water droplets launched by the gun. Snow-makers have to adjust the proportions of water and air in their snow guns to get the perfect snow consistency for the outdoor weather conditions. Many ski slopes now do this with a central computer system that is connected to weather-reading stations all over the slope.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>F</strong> But man-made snow makes heavy demands on the environment. It takes about 275,000 litres of water to create a blanket of snow covering a 60x60 metre area. Most resorts pump water from one or more reservoirs located in low-lying areas. The run-off water from the slopes feeds back into these reservoirs, so the resort can actually use the same water over and over again. However, considerable amounts of energy are needed to run the large air-compressing pumps, and the diesel engines which run them also cause air pollution.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>G</strong> Because of the expense of making snow, ski resorts have to balance the cost of running the machines with the benefits of extending the ski season, making sure they only make snow when it is really needed and when it will bring the maximum amount of profit in return for the investment. But man-made snow has a number of other uses as well. A layer of snow keeps a lot of the Earth’s heat from escaping into the atmosphere, so farmers often use man-made snow to provide insulation for winter crops. Snow-making machines have played a big part in many movie productions. Movie producers often take several months to shoot scenes that cover just a few days. If the movie takes place in a snowy setting, the set decorators have to get the right amount of snow for each day of shooting either by adding man-made snow or melting natural snow. And another important application of man-made snow is its use in the tests that aircraft must undergo in order to ensure that they can function safely in extreme conditions.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><br></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);\\\">Questions 8-10: Label the diagram below.Choose </span><span style=\\\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); color: rgb(230, 0, 0);\\\">NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS</span><span style=\\\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);\\\"> from the passage for each answer.</span></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><img src=\\\"http://localhost:5000/uploads/images/image-1766206265059-29924696.png\\\"></p>\",\"sections\":[{\"sectionTitle\":\"Heading Matching\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p><strong>Questions 1-7</strong></p><p>Reading Passage 1 has SEVEN paragraphs, A-G.Choose the correct heading for paragraphs, A-G, from the list of headings below.Write the correct number, i-x, next to questions 1-7.</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":\"1-7\",\"questionType\":\"ielts-matching-headings\",\"questionText\":\"\",\"options\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"\",\"paragraphs\":[{\"id\":\"A\",\"label\":\"A\",\"text\":\"Paragraph A\"},{\"id\":\"B\",\"label\":\"B\",\"text\":\"Paragraph B\"},{\"id\":\"C\",\"label\":\"C\",\"text\":\"Paragraph C\"},{\"id\":\"D\",\"label\":\"D\",\"text\":\"Paragraph D\"},{\"id\":\"E\",\"label\":\"E\",\"text\":\"Paragraph E\"},{\"id\":\"F\",\"label\":\"F\",\"text\":\"Paragraph F\"},{\"id\":\"G\",\"label\":\"G\",\"text\":\"Paragraph G\"}],\"headings\":[{\"id\":1,\"label\":\"i\",\"text\":\"Considering ecological costs\"},{\"id\":2,\"label\":\"ii\",\"text\":\"Modifications to the design of the snow gun\"},{\"id\":3,\"label\":\"iii\",\"text\":\"The need for different varieties of snow\"},{\"id\":4,\"label\":\"iv\",\"text\":\"Local concern over environmental issues\"},{\"id\":5,\"label\":\"v\",\"text\":\"A problem and a solution\"},{\"id\":6,\"label\":\"vi\",\"text\":\"Applications beyond the ski slopes\"},{\"id\":7,\"label\":\"vii\",\"text\":\"Converting wet snow to dry snow\"},{\"id\":8,\"label\":\"viii\",\"text\":\"New method for calculating modifications\"},{\"id\":9,\"label\":\"ix\",\"text\":\"Artificial process, natural product\"},{\"id\":10,\"label\":\"x\",\"text\":\"Snow formation in nature\"}],\"answers\":{\"A\":\"v\",\"B\":\"x\",\"C\":\"ix\",\"D\":\"iii\",\"E\":\"viii\",\"F\":\"i\",\"G\":\"vi\"},\"hasExtraHeadings\":true,\"blanks\":[{\"id\":\"blank_0\",\"blankNumber\":1,\"paragraphLabel\":\"A\",\"correctAnswer\":\"v\"},{\"id\":\"blank_1\",\"blankNumber\":2,\"paragraphLabel\":\"B\",\"correctAnswer\":\"x\"},{\"id\":\"blank_2\",\"blankNumber\":3,\"paragraphLabel\":\"C\",\"correctAnswer\":\"ix\"},{\"id\":\"blank_3\",\"blankNumber\":4,\"paragraphLabel\":\"D\",\"correctAnswer\":\"iii\"},{\"id\":\"blank_4\",\"blankNumber\":5,\"paragraphLabel\":\"E\",\"correctAnswer\":\"viii\"},{\"id\":\"blank_5\",\"blankNumber\":6,\"paragraphLabel\":\"F\",\"correctAnswer\":\"i\"},{\"id\":\"blank_6\",\"blankNumber\":7,\"paragraphLabel\":\"G\",\"correctAnswer\":\"vi\"}]}]},{\"sectionTitle\":\"Label the Diagram\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p>Questions 8-10: Label the diagram below.Choose NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from the passage for each answer.</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":8,\"questionType\":\"short-answer\",\"questionText\":\"<p>…………… air</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"compressed\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":9,\"questionType\":\"short-answer\",\"questionText\":\"<p>water is atomised into ........</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"tiny | droplets\",\"maxWords\":2},{\"questionNumber\":10,\"questionType\":\"short-answer\",\"questionText\":\"<p>………… are formed</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"ice crystals\",\"maxWords\":2}]},{\"sectionTitle\":\"Section 3\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>Questions 11-13</strong></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Complete the sentences below.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Choose <strong>NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS</strong> from the passage for each answer.</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":\"11,12,13\",\"questionType\":\"cloze-test\",\"questionText\":\"\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"\",\"paragraphText\":\"The machinery used in the process of making the snow consumes a lot of [BLANK] which is damaging to the environment.

The notice says, ‘You may not have seen me, but I have seen you.’ There are more than a billion people in India and Indian tigers probably see humans every single day of their lives. Tigers can and do kill almost everything they meet in the jungle, they will kill even attack elephants and rhino. Surely, then, it is a little strange that attacks on humans are not more frequent.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>B</strong>&nbsp;Some people might argue that these attacks were, in fact, common in the past. British writers of adventure stories, such as Jim Corbett, gave the impression that village life in India in the early years of the twentieth century involved a stage of constant siege by man-eating tigers. But they may have overstated the terror spread by tigers. There were also far more tigers around in those days (probably 60.000 in the subcontinent compared to just 3000 today). So in proportion, attacks appear to have been as rare then as they are today.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>C</strong> It is widely assumed that the constraint is fear; but what exactly are tigers afraid of? Can they really know that we may be even better armed than they are? Surely not. Have the species programmed the experiences of all tigers with humans its genes to be inherited as instinct? Perhaps. But I think the explanation may be more simple and, in a way, more intriguing.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>D</strong> Since the growth of ethology in the 1950s. we have tried to understand animal behaviour from the animal’s point of view. Until the first elegant experiments by pioneers in the field such as Konrad Lorenz, naturalists wrote about animals as if they were slightly less intelligent humans. Jim Corbett’s breathless accounts of his duels with man-eaters in truth tell us more about Jim Corbett than they do about the animals. The principle of ethology, on the other hand, requires us to attempt to think in the same way as the animal we are studying thinks, and to observe every tiny detail of its behaviour without imposing our own human significances on its actions.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>E</strong> I suspect that a tiger’s afraid of humans lies not in some pre-programmed ancestral logic but in the way he actually perceives us visually. If you think like a tiger, a human in a car might appear just to be a part of the car, and because tigers don’t eat cars the human is safe-unless the car is menacing the tiger or its cubs, in which case a brave or enraged tiger may charge. A human on foot is a different sort of puzzle. Imagine a tiger seeing a man who is 1.8m tall. A tiger is less than 1m tall but it may be up to 3m long from head to tail. So when a tiger sees the man face on, it might not be unreasonable for him to assume that the man is 6m long. If he meets a deer of this size, he might attack the animal by leaping on its back, but when he looks behind the mind he can’t see a back. From the front, the man is huge, but looked at from the side he all but disappears. This must be very disconcerting. A hunter has to be confident that it can tackle its prey, and no one is confident when they are disconcerted. This is especially true of a solitary hunter such as the tiger and may explain why lions-particularly young lionesses who tend to encourage one another to take risks are more dangerous than tigers.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>F </strong>If the theory that a tiger is disconcerted to find that a standing human is both very big and yet somehow invisible is correct, the opposite should be true of a squatting human. A squatting human is half the size and presents twice the spread of back, and more closely resembles a medium-sized deer. If tigers were simply frightened of all humans, then a squatting person would be no more attractive as a target than a standing one. This, however, appears not to be the case. Many incidents of attacks on people involving villagers squatting or bending over to cut grass for fodder or building material.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>G</strong> The fact that humans stand upright may therefore not just be something that distinguishes them from nearly all other species, but also a factor that helped them to survive in a dangerous and unpredictable environment.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong><em><u>Note</u></em></strong><em><u>:</u></em></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><em>Ethology = the branch of zoology that studies the behaviour of animals in their natural habitats.</em></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><br></p>\",\"sections\":[{\"sectionTitle\":\"Paragraph Matching (Q14-18)\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>Questions 14-18: </strong>Which paragraph contains the following information?</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Write the correct letter, <strong>A-G</strong>, next to questions 14-18.</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":14,\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>………. a rejected explanation of why tiger attacks on humans are rare.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"C\",\"leftItems\":[\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\",\"F\",\"G\"],\"rightItems\":[\"14. a rejected explanation of why tiger attacks on humans are rare.\",\"15. a reason why tiger attacks on humans might be expected to happen more often than they do.\",\"16. examples of situations in which humans are more likely to be attacked by tigers.\",\"17. a claim about the relative frequency of tiger attacks on humans.\",\"18. an explanation of tiger behaviour based on the principles of ethology.\"],\"matches\":[\"2\",\"4\",\"1\",null,\"5\",\"3\"]},{\"questionNumber\":15,\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>………. a reason why tiger attacks on humans might be expected to happen more often than they do.</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"A\"},{\"questionNumber\":16,\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>………. examples of situations in which humans are more likely to be attacked by tigers.</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"F\"},{\"questionNumber\":17,\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>………. a claim about the relative frequency of tiger attacks on humans.</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"B\"},{\"questionNumber\":18,\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>………. an explanation of tiger behaviour based on the principles of ethology.</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"E\"}]},{\"sectionTitle\":\"Do the following statements agree with the information given in Reading Passage 2?\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>Questions 19-23</strong></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Do the following statements agree with the information given in Reading Passage 2?</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">In the drop-down list next to questions 19-23, select</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">TRUE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the statement agrees with the information</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">FALSE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the statement contradicts the information</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">NOT GIVEN&nbsp;If there is no information on this</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":19,\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>&nbsp;Tigers in the Bandhavgarh National Park are a protected species.</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"NOT GIVEN\"},{\"questionNumber\":20,\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>&nbsp;Some writers of fiction have exaggerated the danger of tigers to man.</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"TRUE\"},{\"questionNumber\":21,\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>The fear of humans may be passed down in a tiger's genes.</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"TRUE\"},{\"questionNumber\":22,\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Konrad Lorenz claimed that some animals are more intelligent than humans.</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"NOT GIVEN\"},{\"questionNumber\":23,\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Ethology involves applying principles of human behaviour to animals.</p>\",\"options\":[\"\"],\"correctAnswer\":\"FALSE\"}]},{\"sectionTitle\":\"Choose the correct answer\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>Questions 24-26</strong></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Choose the correct answer, <strong>A.

Ancient Egyptian physicians used extracts from the willow tree as an analgesic, or pain killer. Centuries later the Greek physician Hippocrates recommended the bark of the willow tree as a remedy for the pains of childbirth and as a fever reducer. But it wasn't until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that salicylates the chemical found in the willow tree became the subject of serious scientific investigation. The race was on to identify the active ingredient and to replicate it synthetically. At the end of the nineteenth century a German company, Friedrich Bayer &amp; Co. succeeded in creating a relatively safe and very effective chemical compound, acetylsalicylic acid, which was renamed aspirin.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">The late nineteenth century was a fertile period for experimentation, partly because of the hunger among scientists to answer some of the great scientific questions, but also because those questions were within their means to answer. One scientist in a laboratory with some chemicals and a test tube could make significant breakthroughs whereas today, in order to map the human genome for instance, one needs ‘an army of researchers, a bank of computers and millions and millions of dollars.’</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">But an understanding of the nature of science and scientific inquiry is not enough on its own to explain how society innovates. In the nineteenth century, scientific advance was closely linked to the industrial revolution. This was a period when people frequently had the means, motive and determination to take an idea and turn it into reality. In the case of aspirin that happened piecemeal - a series of minor, often unrelated advances, fertilised by the century’s broader economic, medical and scientific developments, that led to one big final breakthrough.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">The link between big money and pharmaceutical innovation is also a significant one. Aspirin's continued shelf life was ensured because, for the first 70 years of its life, huge amounts of money were put into promoting it as an ordinary everyday analgesic. In the 1070s other analgesics, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, were entering the market, and the pharmaceutical companies then focused on publicising these new drugs. But just at the same time, discoveries were made regarding the beneficial role of aspirin in preventing heart attacks, strokes and other afflictions. Had it not been for these findings, this pharmaceutical marvel may well have disappeared.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">So the relationship between big money and drugs is an odd one. Commercial markets are necessary for developing new products and ensuring that they remain around long enough for scientists to carry out research on them. But the commercial markets are just as likely to kill off' certain products when something more attractive comes along. In the case of aspirin, a potential ‘wonder drug* was around for over 70 years without anybody investigating the way in which it achieved its effects, because they were making more than enough money out of it as it was. If ibuprofen or paracetamol had entered the market just a decade earlier, aspirin might then not be here today. It would be just another forgotten drug that people hadn't bothered to explore.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">None of the recent discoveries of aspirin's benefits was made by the big pharmaceutical companies; they were made by scientists working in the public sector. 'The reason for that is very simple and straightforward,' Jeffreys says in his book. 'Drug companies will only pursue research that is going to deliver financial benefits. There's no profit in aspirin anymore. It is incredibly inexpensive with tiny profit margins and it has no patent anymore, so anyone can produce it.' In fact, there's almost a disincentive for drug companies to further boost the drug, he argues, as it could possibly put them out of business by stopping them from selling their more expensive brands.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">So what is the solution to a lack of commercial interest in further exploring the therapeutic benefits of aspirin? More public money going into clinical trials, says Jeffreys. ‘If I were the Department of Health. I would say “this is a very inexpensive drug. There may be a lot of other things we could do with it.\\\" We should put a lot more money into trying to find out.'</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Jeffreys' book which not only tells the tale of a 'wonder drug' but also explores the nature of innovation and the role of big business, public money and regulation reminds us why such research is so important.</p><p

These two unique aspects, one political, the other natural, make food production highly vulnerable and different from any other business. At the same time, cultural values are highly entrenched in food and agricultural systems worldwide.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>B</strong> Farmers everywhere face major risks, including extreme weather, long-term climate change, and price volatility in input and product markets. However, smallholder farmers in developing countries must in addition deal with adverse environments, both natural, in terms of soil quality, rainfall, etc., and human, in terms of infrastructure, financial systems, markets, knowledge and technology. Counter-intuitively, hunger is prevalent among many smallholder farmers in the developing world.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>C</strong> Participants in the online debate argued that our biggest challenge is to address the underlying causes of the agricultural system’s inability to ensure sufficient food for all, and they identified as drivers of this problem our dependency on fossil fuels and unsupportive government policies.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>D</strong> On the question of mitigating the risks farmers face, most essayists called for greater state intervention. In his essay, Kanayo F. Nwanze, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, argued that governments can significantly reduce risks for farmers by providing basic services like roads to get produce more efficiently to markets, or water and food storage facilities to reduce losses. Sophia Murphy, senior advisor to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, suggested that the procurement and holding of stocks by governments can also help mitigate wild swings in food prices by alleviating uncertainties about market supply.&nbsp;</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>E</strong> Shenggen Fan, Director General of the International Food Policy Research Institute, help up social safety nets and public welfare programmes in Ethiopia, Brazil and Mexico as valuable ways to address poverty among farming families and reduce their vulnerability to agriculture shocks. However, some commentators responded that cash transfers to poor families do not necessarily translate into increased food security, as these programmes do not always strengthen food production or raise incomes. Regarding state subsidies for agriculture, Rokeya Kabir, Executive Director of Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha, commented in her essay that these ‘have not compensated for the stranglehold exercised by private traders. In fact, studies show that sixty percent of beneficiaries of subsidies are not poor, but rich landowners and non-farmer traders.’</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>F</strong> Nwanze, Murphy and Fan argued that private risk management tools, like private insurance, commodity futures markets, and rural finance can help small-scale producers mitigate risk and allow for investment in improvements. Kabir warned that financial support schemes often encourage the adoption of high-input agricultural practices, which in the medium term may raise production costs beyond the value of their harvests. Murphy noted that when futures markets become excessively financialised they can contribute to short-term price volatility, which increases farmers’ food insecurity. Many participants and commentators emphasised that greater transparency in markets is needed to mitigate the impact of volatility, and make evident whether adequate stocks and supplies are available. Others contended that agribusiness companies should be held responsible for paying for negative side effects.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>G</strong> Many essayists mentioned climate change and its consequences for small-scale agriculture. Fan explained that ‘in addition to reducing crop yields, climate change increases the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events, which increase smallholder vulnerability.’ The growing unpredictability of weather patterns increases farmers’ difficulty in managing weather-related risks. According to this author, one solution would be to develop crop varieties that are more resilient to new climate trends and extreme weather patterns. Accordingly, Pat Mooney, co-founder and executive director of the ETC Group, suggested that ‘if we are to survive climate change, we must adopt policies that let peasants diversify the plant and animal species and varieties/breeds that make up our menus.’</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>H</strong> Some participating authors and commentators argued in favour of community-based and autonomous risk management strategies through collective action groups, co-operatives or producers’ groups. Such groups enhance market opportunities for small-scale producers, reduce marketing costs and synchronise buying and selling with seasonal price conditions. According to Murphy, ‘collective action offers an important way for farmers to strengthen their political and economic bargaining power, and to reduce their business risks.’ One commentator, Giel Ton, warned that collective action does not come as a free good. It takes time, effort and money to organise, build trust and to experiment. Others, like Marcel Vernooij and Marcel Beukeboom, suggested that in order to ‘apply what we already know’, all stakeholders, including business, government, scientists and civil society, must work together, starting at the beginning of the value chain.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>I</strong> Some participants explained that market price volatility is often worsened by the presence of intermediary purchasers who, taking advantage of farmers’ vulnerability, dictate prices. One commentator suggested farmers can gain greater control over prices and minimise price volatility by selling directly to consumers. Similarly, Sonali Bisht, founder and advisor to the Institute of Himalayan Environmental Research and Education (INHERE), India, wrote that community-supported agriculture, where consumers invest in local farmers by subscription and guarantee producers a fair price, is a risk-sharing model worth more attention. Direct food distribution systems not only encourage small-scale agriculture but also give consumers more control over the food they consume, she wrote.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">———————</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><em>* The personal names in the text refer to the authors of written contributions to the online debate</em></p>\",\"sections\":[{\"sectionTitle\":\"READING PASSAGE 1 - You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1–11, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p><strong>Questions 1-3</strong></p><p>Reading Passage 1 has nine paragraphs, A-I.</p><p>Which paragraph contains the following information?</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":1,\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>... a reference to characteristics that only apply to food production</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"A\"},{\"questionNumber\":2,\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>... a reference to challenges faced only by farmers in certain parts of the world</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"B\"},{\"questionNumber\":\"3\",\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>... a reference to difficulties in bringing about co-operation between&nbsp;</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"H\"}]},{\"sectionTitle\":\"Section 2\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p><strong>Questions 4-9</strong></p><p>Look at the following statements (Question 4-9) and the list of people below.</p><p>Match each statement with the correct person, A-G.</p><p>NB&nbsp;You may use any letter more than once.</p><p>List of People</p><p><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanayo F.

Many forms of collecting have been dignified with a technical name: an archtophilist collects teddy bears, a philatelist collects postage stamps, and a deltiologist collects postcards. Amassing hundreds or even thousands of postcards, chocolate wrappers or whatever, takes time, energy and money that could surely be put to much more productive use. And yet there are millions of collectors around the world. Why do they do it?</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">There are the people who collect because they want to make money – this could be called an instrumental reason for collecting; that is, collecting as a means to an end. They’ll look for, say, antiques that they can buy cheaply and expect to be able to sell at a profit. But there may well be a psychological element, too – buying cheap and selling dear can give the collector a sense of triumph. And as selling online is so easy, more and more people are joining in.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Many collectors collect to develop their social life, attending meetings of a group of collectors and exchanging information on items. This is a variant on joining a bridge club or a gym, and similarly brings them into contact with like-minded people.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Another motive for collecting is the desire to find something special, or a particular example of the collected item, such as a rare early recording by a particular singer. Some may spend their whole lives in a hunt for this. Psychologically, this can give a purpose to a life that otherwise feels aimless. There is a danger, though, that if the individual is ever lucky enough to find what they’re looking for, rather than celebrating their success, they may feel empty, now that the goal that drove them on has gone.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">If you think about collecting postage stamps, another potential reason for it – or, perhaps, a result of collecting – is its educational value. Stamp collecting opens a window to other countries, and to the plants, animals, or famous people shown on their stamps. Similarly, in the 19th century, many collectors amassed fossils, animals and plants from around the globe, and their collections provided a vast amount of information about the natural world. Without those collections, our understanding would be greatly inferior to what it is.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">In the past – and nowadays, too, though to a lesser extent – a popular form of collecting, particularly among boys and men, was trainspotting. This might involve trying to see every locomotive of a particular type, using published data that identifies each one, and ticking off each engine as it is seen. Trainspotters exchange information, these days often by mobile phone, so they can work out where to go to, to see a particular engine. As a by-product, many practitioners of the hobby become very knowledgeable about railway operations, or the technical specifications of different engine types.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Similarly, people who collect dolls may go beyond simply enlarging their collection, and develop an interest in the way that dolls are made, or the materials that are used. These have changed over the centuries from the wood that was standard in 16th century Europe, through the wax and porcelain of later centuries, to the plastics of today’s dolls. Or collectors might be inspired to study how dolls reflect notions of what children like, or ought to like.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Not all collectors are interested in learning from their hobby, though, so what we might call a psychological reason for collecting is the need for a sense of control, perhaps as a way of dealing with insecurity. Stamps collectors, for instance, arrange their stamps in albums, usually very neatly, organising their collection according to certain commonplace principles – perhaps by country in alphabetical order, or grouping stamps by what they depict – people, birds, maps, and so on.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">One reason, conscious or not, for&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;someone chooses to collect is to show the collector’s individualism. Someone who decides to collect something as unexpected as dos collars, for instance, may be conveying their belief that they must be interesting themselves. And believe it or not, there is at least one dog collar museum in existence, and it grew out of a personal collection.</p><p>Of course, all hobbies give pleasure, but the common factor in collecting is usually passion: pleasure is putting it far too mildly. More than most other hobbies, collecting can be totally engrossing, and can give a strong sense of personal fulfilment. To non-collectors it may appear an eccentric, if harmless, way of spending time, but potentially, collecting has a lot going for it.</p>\",\"sections\":[{\"sectionTitle\":\"Questions: 14-21 Complete the sentences below\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p><strong>Questions 14-21</strong></p><p>Complete the sentences below.</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Choose&nbsp;<strong>ONE WORD ONLY</strong>&nbsp;from the passage for each answer.</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":\"14\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p>The writer mentions collecting ………… as an example of collecting in order to make money.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"antiques\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"15\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Collectors may get a feeling of ………… from buying and selling items.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"triumph\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"16\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Collectors’ clubs provide opportunities to share …………</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"information\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"17\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Collectors’ clubs offer ………… with people who have similar interests.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"contact | meetings\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"18\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Collecting sometimes involves a life-long ………… for a special item.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"hunt | desire\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"19\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Searching for something particular may prevent people from feeling their life is completely ………… </p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"aimless | empty\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"20\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Stamp collecting may be ………… because it provides facts about different countries.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"educational\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"21\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p>………… tends to be mostly a male hobby.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"trainspotting\",\"maxWords\":1}]},{\"sectionTitle\":\"In the drop-down list next to questions 22-26, select \",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>Questions 22-26</strong></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\">Do the following statements agree with the information given in Reading Passage 2?</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">In the blanks next to questions 20-24, write</span></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>TRUE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the statement agrees with the information</p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong>FALSE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the statement contradicts the information</p><p><strong>NOT GIVEN</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is no information on this</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":\"22\",\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>The number of people buying dolls has grown over the centuries.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"NOT GIVEN\",\"maxSelection\":2,\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"23\",\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Sixteenth century European dolls were normally made of wax and porcelain.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"FALSE\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"24\",\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Arranging a stamp collection by the size of the stamps is less common than other methods.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"NOT GIVEN\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"25\",\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Someone who collects unusual objects may want others to think he or she is also unusual.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"TRUE\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"26\",\"questionType\":\"true-false-not-given\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Collecting gives a feeling that other hobbies are unlikely to inspire.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"TRUE\",\"maxWords\":1}]}]},{\"passageTitle\":\"Music and the emotions\",\"passageText\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-center\\\"><em style=\\\"color: black;\\\">Neuroscientist Jonah Lehrer considers the emotional power of music</em></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">Why does music make us feel? One the one hand, music is a purely abstract art form, devoid of language or explicit ideas. And yet, even though music says little, it still manages to touch us deeply. When listening to our favourite songs, our body betrays all the symptoms of emotional arousal. The pupils in our eyes dilate, our pulse and blood pressure rise, the electrical conductance of our skin is lowered, and the cerebellum, a brain region associated with bodily movement, becomes strangely active. Blood is even re-directed to the muscles in our legs. In other words, sound stirs us at our biological roots.</span></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">A recent paper in&nbsp;</span><em style=\\\"color: black;\\\">Nature Neuroscience&nbsp;</em><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">by a research team in Montreal, Canada, marks an important step in revealing the precise underpinnings of the potent pleasurable stimulus’ that is music. Although the study involves plenty of fancy technology, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and ligand-based positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, the experiment itself was rather straightforward. After screening 217 individuals who responded to advertisements requesting people who experience ‘chills’ to instrumental music, the scientists narrowed down the subject pool to ten. They then asked the subjects to bring in their playlist of favourite songs – virtually every genre was represented, from techno to tango – and played them the music while their brain activity was monitored. Because the scientists were combining methodologies (PET and fMRI), they were able to obtain an impressively exact and detailed portrait of music in the brain. The first thing they discovered is that music triggers the production of dopamine – a chemical with a key role in setting people’s moods – by the neurons (nerve cells) in both the dorsal and ventral regions of the brain. As these two regions have long been linked with the experience of pleasure, this finding isn’t particularly surprising.</span></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">What is rather more significant is the finding that the dopamine neurons in the caudate – a region of the brain involved in learning stimulus-response associations, and in anticipating food and other ‘reward’ stimuli – were at their most active around 15 seconds before the participants’ favourite moments in the music. The researchers call this the ‘anticipatory phase’ and argue that the purpose of this activity is to help us predict the arrival of our favourite part. The question, of course, is what all these dopamine neurons are up to. Why are they so active in the period&nbsp;</span><em style=\\\"color: black;\\\">preceding&nbsp;</em><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">the acoustic climax? After all, we typically associate surges of dopamine with pleasure, with the processing of&nbsp;</span><em style=\\\"color: black;\\\">actual&nbsp;</em><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">rewards. And yet, this cluster of cells is most active when the ‘chills’ have yet to arrive, when the melodic pattern is still unresolved.</span></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">One way to answer the question is to look at the music and not the neurons. While music can often seem (at least to the outsider) like a labyrinth of intricate patterns, it turns out that the most important part of every song or symphony is when the patterns break down, when the sound becomes unpredictable. If the music is too obvious, it is annoyingly boring, like an alarm clock. Numerous studies, after all, have demonstrated that dopamine neurons quickly adapt to predictable rewards. If we know what’s going to happen next, then we don’t get excited. This is why composers often introduce a key note in the beginning of a song, spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious avoidance of the pattern, and then finally repeat it only at the end. The longer we are denied the pattern we expect, the greater the emotional release when the pattern returns, safe and sound.</span></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">To demonstrate this psychological principle, the musicologist Leonard Meyer, in his classic book&nbsp;</span><em style=\\\"color: black;\\\">Emotion and Meaning in Music&nbsp;</em><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">(1956), analysed the 5th movement of Beethoven’s String Quartet in C-sharp minor, Op. 131. Meyer wanted to show how music is defined by its flirtation with – but not submission to – our expectations of order. Meyer dissected 50 measures (bars) of the masterpiece, showing how Beethoven begins with the clear statement of a rhythmic and harmonic pattern and then, in an ingenious tonal dance, carefully holds off repeating it. What Beethoven does instead is suggest variations of the pattern. He wants to preserve an element of uncertainty in his music, making our brains beg for the one chord he refuses to give us. Beethoven saves that chord for the end.</span></p><p><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">According to Meyer, it is the suspenseful tension of music, arising out of our unfulfilled expectations, that is the source of the music’s feeling. While earlier theories of music focused on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences – its ‘connotative’ meaning – Meyer argued that the emotions we find in music come from the unfolding events of the music itself. This ‘embodied meaning’ arises from the patterns the symphony invokes and then ignores. It is this uncertainty that triggers the surge of dopamine in the caudate, as we struggle to figure out what will happen next. We can predict some of the notes, but we can’t predict them all, and that is what keeps us listening, waiting expectantly for our reward, for the pattern to be completed.</span></p>\",\"sections\":[{\"sectionTitle\":\"Complete the summary below.\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><strong style=\\\"color: black;\\\">Questions 27-31</strong></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><span style=\\\"color: black;\\\">Complete the summary below.</span></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-justify\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); color: black;\\\">Choose&nbsp;</span><strong style=\\\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); color: black;\\\">NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS</strong><span style=\\\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); color: black;\\\">&nbsp;from the passage for each answer.</span></p><p class=\\\"ql-align-center\\\"><strong class=\\\"ql-size-large\\\" style=\\\"color: rgb(0, 138, 0);\\\">The Montreal Study</strong></p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":\"27-31\",\"questionType\":\"cloze-test\",\"questionText\":\"\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"\",\"paragraphText\":\"Participants, who were recruited for the study through advertisements, had their brain activity monitored while listening to their favourite music.

According to Erik Millstone, a food and agriculture researcher funded by the Economic and Social Research Council(ESRC), the natural science community tends to view world hunger as if it were a problem that could be solved simply by increasing total production. But, he says, 'Most people who are chronically hungry are so not because of the scarcity of food but because they are unable to afford what is available. In addition, the food trade is so globalised that food is often exported from areas where people are hungry and sent to countries where people already have sufficient.'</p><p>&nbsp;Millstone believes the problem can only be solved by changing the conditions for poor subsistence farmers and providing the support they need to grow more food. And that is not enough on its own-they also have to have facilities for storing it so that their food can be kept safe and in good condition until it is needed. But, he adds, increasing productivity through technology is not the answer. An example is the new genetically-engineered varieties of high-performance maize. The problem with these new varieties is that if you save seed and plant it again next year, its vigour has diminished. Most North American and European farmers can afford to get new seed every year; poor farmers cannot, so they need traditional varieties whose seed can be saved and replanted. Giving farmers access to credit also doesn't help; it adds risk. ' Poor farmers should not be thought of as entrepreneurs looking to invest their money. They are looking to diminish their risk.' Ultimately, he concludes, 'Instead of devoting resources to research for intensifying commercial farming, we should devote them to enhancing the techniques available to subsistence farmers, and to developing appropriate tools for them to use, because their need is the greatest. Increasing their productivity will do more to enhance food security for those who are hungry than anything else we can do.'</p><p><strong>Looking for local solutions in the UK</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In contrast to Millstone, Gareth Edwards-Jones a professor of agriculture and land use at the University of Bangor in Wales, focuses on food production in the UK. In recent years 'local food' has become fashionable in the UK without any real understanding of the issues involved. First and foremost, it is necessary to define more precisely what is meant by 'local'. Is bread bought in England from an English bakery \\\"local\\\" if the wheat it is made from was grown in Canada? Funded through the Rural Economy and Land Use Programme, Edwards Jones is studying people's perceptions of ‘localness' and seeking to establish whether there is any science behind the popular belief that \\\"local Is better'.</p><p>His work involves studying the carbon footprint* of foods grown in different areas of the UK, as well as such common sources of supply as Spain, Kenya and Uganda. He has made some surprising discoveries. Which has the lower carbon footprint: sugar made from sugar cane grown in Africa, or from sugar beet flown in from Europe? The answer is sugar from sugar cane in Africa. Similarly, trucking vegetables in from Spain may have a smaller carbon footprint than growing them locally in the UK-because growing them locally requires adding all the emissions of running a heated greenhouse.</p><p>&nbsp;And, he asks, how far down the life cycle should you go? He discovered early in his research that the methods used to prepare foods to be eaten can have a huge impact; boiling potatoes accounts for fully half their carbon footprint. Ultimately, it's a mistake to look at Just one part of the food chain. You could have a policy where you're going to really pressurise farmers to try to get emissions down, but decarbonising fuel and electricity is a much more effective method of protecting the environment; he says.</p><p>&nbsp;Another of Edwards-jones's research projects involved visiting farm workers in each of the above countries to assess their health and well-being. We found that farm workers in Kenya had better physical and mental health than the average Kenyan, 'he says, attributing the difference to both better income and to the benefits-housing, schools, medical care provided by their large corporate employers. He finds it ironic that after years of 'trade not aid' all of a sudden people are starting to say the UK shouldn't be importing food from Africa.</p><p>The other problem with insisting on locally grown food, he says, is that the UK is not suited to growing most fruits and vegetables-the key elements in a healthy diet. These crops need our best land-which means demoting other crops that do grow well in the UK to lower quality land. 'There's a domino effect so that increasing self-sufficiency may, from an environmental perspective, be quite bad, 'he says.</p>\",\"sections\":[{\"sectionTitle\":\"Section 1\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p><strong>Questions 1-8</strong> Complete the notes below.

They show a fleet of ships bearing exotic cargo, navigating through high-crested waves on a journey. The exact meaning of these detailed carvings has divided Egyptologists ever since they were discovered in the mid-19th century. Some people have argued that Punt was not on the sea, or a fictitious place altogether, says Oxford University Egyptologist John Baines. However, a series of remarkable discoveries on a desolate stretch of Egypt's Red Sea coast has settled the debate. These finds remove all doubt that you reach Punt by sea. 'Baines says. The Egyptians must have had considerable seagoing experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>B</strong>&nbsp;The archaeologists behind these discoveries are Kathryn Bard of Boston University, USA, and Rodolfo Fattovich of Orientale University, Italy. From 2002 they spent several weeks each year examining a dried-up lagoon known in Egypt as Mersa Gawasis, and the coastal cliffs nearby. They were searching for signs of a harbour that might have sheltered merchant ships like those depicted in the wall carvings. Finally, in December 2004, Bard was clearing what she thought was the back wall of a rock shelter when she put her hand through the sand into an open space, and uncovered a hemispherical cave about 5 metres across and 2 metres high. The cave's entrance was carved into an exact rectangle and was clearly not a natural formation. Inside, the archaeologists found shattered storage jars, broken boxes made from cedar planks, and five grinding stones. A pottery fragment inscribed with the name of Amenemhat III, a pharaoh who ruled Egypt around 1800 BC, helped the team pinpoint the cave's age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>C </strong>&nbsp;Not long afterwards, Bard and Fattovich came across a larger cave, reinforced with old wooden timbers and stone anchors, the first conclusive evidence of large-scale Egyptian seafaring ever discovered. Over the next few years, they uncovered the hidden remnants of an ancient boat-building and seafaring community. Many of the artefacts found were full of holes—the work of tiny marine animals known as shipworms. In addition to eight caves, Bard and Fattovich found remains of five mud-brick ramps that might have been used to ease ships into the water. One cave contained hundreds of metres of rope, expertly coiled and stacked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>D</strong>&nbsp;Material connecting Mersa Gawasis to Punt accumulated both inside and outside the caves. A few hundred metres from the cliffs lie piles of crumbled stone and conch shells—most probably the remains of altars. Among these are stones carved with inscriptions that specifically mention missions to Punt. As if that weren't enough, among the remnants found outside one cave were two planks marked with directions for assembling a ship. One of them bore an inscription still partly legible after 3,800 years: \\\"Year 8 under his majesty the king of Upper and Lower Egypt...given life forever...of wonderful things of Punt.\\\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>E </strong> While the Mersa Gawasis artefacts have answered some questions, they have raised others. For instance, how did the expeditions to Punt actually work, and how did the Egyptians construct vessels that could make a round-trip voyage of over 3,000 kilometres? Cheryl Ward, a maritime archaeologist at Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina, USA, has gone some way to answering these questions. She spent three years building a full-scale reconstruction of a ship that would have docked in the lagoon of Mersa Gawasis. Ward has determined that unlike modern vessels, the Egyptian ship was essentially one giant hull. The Egyptian ships were also unique in that they were held together with fittings that needed no metal fasteners, and could be taken apart and put back together again. \\\"From the very beginning, the Egyptians were building boats that could be disassembled, and that makes them different from anyone else,\\\" Ward says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>F</strong>&nbsp;For all the skill and craftsmanship evident in the Mersa Gawasis caves, ancient Egypt's ocean voyages were most likely an exception to the usual modes of trade, born out of a necessity to obtain precious materials, such as incense and aromatic resins. For most of Egypt's history these goods had moved along established routes across the eastern desert and through modern-day Sudan. But around the time Mersa Gawasis came into use, it seems a hostile new kingdom to the south cut Egypt off from its supply of exotic materials. \\\"If they could have gone overland, it would have been much easier than bringing timbers from Lebanon, building ships on the upper Nile, taking them apart and carrying them across the desert,\\\" Bard says. \\\"They weren't stupid—no one wants to do things the hard way. But geopolitically, they had no other choice.\\\" Fattovich suggests that there were probably only 15 to 20 expeditions over some 400 years, about one every two decades. After that Mersa Gawasis fell out of use, probably because either there was no longer enough water in the lagoon to float ships, or overland links improved, or alternative sites were found. The last sailors to use the lagoon sealed up their equipment and shelters behind mud bricks and sand to await expeditions that never came.</p>\",\"sections\":[{\"sectionTitle\":\"Section 1\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p><strong>Questions 14-17</strong></p><p><strong>Reading Passage 2</strong> has six paragraphs, A-F.</p><p>Which paragraph contains the following information?</p><p>Write the correct letter, A-F in boxes 14-17 on your answer sheet.</p><p><strong>NB: You may use any letter more than once</strong>.</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":\"14\",\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>... possible reasons why the site of Mersa Gawasis was abandoned</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"F\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"15\",\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>... mention of a lack of agreement about an archaeological discovery</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"A\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"16\",\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>... reference to a study which involved copying ancient Egyptian boat-building techniques</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"E\",\"maxWords\":1},{\"questionNumber\":\"17\",\"questionType\":\"paragraph-matching\",\"questionText\":\"<p>... a reason why the ancient Egyptians needed to import goods by sea</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"F\",\"maxWords\":1}]},{\"sectionTitle\":\"Section 2\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p><strong>Questions 18-21</strong></p><p>Complete the sentences below.</p><p>Choose <strong>ONE WORD ONLY</strong> from the passage for each answer.</p><p>Write your answers in boxes 18-21 on your answer sheet.</p>\",\"sectionImage\":null,\"questions\":[{\"questionNumber\":\"18\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Illustration of merchant ships sailing from Punt were found on wall carvings in an ancient _………… in Egypt.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"Temple\",\"maxWords\":1,\"paragraphText\":\"\",\"blanks\":[{\"id\":\"blank1\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"blank2\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"blank3\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"}]},{\"questionNumber\":\"19\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Bard and Fattovich hoped to find evidence of a…………in the area of Mersa Gawasis.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"Harbour\",\"maxWords\":1,\"paragraphText\":\"\",\"blanks\":[{\"id\":\"blank1\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"blank2\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"blank3\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"}]},{\"questionNumber\":\"20\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p>When Bard first discovered a cave at Mersa Gawasis, the shape of its…………indicated that it was man-made.</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"Entrance\",\"maxWords\":1,\"paragraphText\":\"\",\"blanks\":[{\"id\":\"blank1\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"blank2\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"blank3\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"}]},{\"questionNumber\":\"21\",\"questionType\":\"fill-in-the-blanks\",\"questionText\":\"<p>Bard and Fattovich discovered a considerable number of objects that had been made by small sea creatures known as…………</p>\",\"options\":[],\"correctAnswer\":\"Holes\",\"maxWords\":1,\"paragraphText\":\"\",\"blanks\":[{\"id\":\"blank1\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"blank2\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"blank3\",\"correctAnswer\":\"\"}]}]},{\"sectionTitle\":\"Section 3\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p><strong>Questions 22-26</strong></p><p>Look at the following statements (Questions 22-26) and the list of archaeologists below.</p><p>Match each statement with the correct archaeologist A, B, C, or D.

Yet such communication is fraught with challenges that can easily distort discussions, leading to unnecessary confusion and misunderstandings.</p><p>Some problems stem from the esoteric nature of current research and the associated difficulty of finding sufficiently faithful terminology. Abstraction and complexity are not signs that a given scientific direction is wrong, as some commentators have suggested, but are instead a tribute to the success of human ingenuity in meeting the increasingly complex challenges that nature presents. They can, however, make communication more difficult. But many of the biggest challenges for science reporting arise because in areas of evolving research, scientists themselves often only partly understand the full implications of any particular advance or development. Since that dynamic applies to most of the scientific developments that directly affect people’s lives, global warming, cancer research, diet studies – learning how to overcome it is critical to spurring a more informed scientific debate among the broader public.</p><p>Ambiguous word choices are the source of some misunderstandings. Scientists often employ colloquial terminology, which they then assign a specific meaning that is impossible to fathom without proper training. The term “relativity,” for example, is intrinsically misleading. Many interpret the theory to mean that everything is relative and there are no absolutes. Yet although the measurements any observer makes depend on his coordinates and reference frame, the physical phenomena he measures have an invariant description that transcends that observer’s particular coordinates. Einstein’s theory of relativity is really about finding an invariant description of physical phenomena. True, Einstein agreed with the idea that his theory would have been better named “Invarianten theorie.” But the term “relativity” was already entrenched at the time for him to change.</p><p>“The uncertainty principle” is another frequently abused term. It is sometimes interpreted as a limitation on observers and their ability to make measurements. But it is not about intrinsic limitations on any one particular measurement; it is about the inability to precisely measure particular pairs of quantities simultaneously? The first interpretation is perhaps more engaging from a philosophical or political perspective. It’s just not what the science is about.</p><p>Even the word “theory” can be a problem. Unlike most people, who use the word to describe a passing conjecture that they often regard as suspect, physicists have very specific ideas in mind when they talk about theories. For physicists, theories entail a definite physical framework embodied in a set of fundamental assumptions about the world that lead to a specific set of equations and predictions – ones that are borne out by successful predictions. Theories aren’t necessarily shown to be correct or complete immediately. Even Einstein took the better part of a decade to develop the correct version of his theory of general relativity. But eventually both the ideas and the measurements settle down and theories are either proven correct, abandoned or absorbed into other, more encompassing theories.</p><p>“Global warming” is another example of problematic terminology. Climatologists predict more drastic fluctuations in temperature and rainfall – not necessarily that every place will be warmer. The name sometimes subverts the debate, since it lets people argue that their winter was worse, so how could there be global warming? Clearly “global climate change” would have been a better name. But not all problems stem solely from poor word choices. Some stem from the intrinsically complex nature of much of modern science. Science sometimes transcends this limitation: remarkably, chemists were able to detail the precise chemical processes involved in the destruction of the ozone layer, making the evidence that chlorofluorocarbon gases (Freon, for example) were destroying the ozone layer indisputable.</p><p>A better understanding of the mathematical significance of results and less insistence on a simple story would help to clarify many scientific discussions. For several months, Harvard was tortured months, Harvard was tortured by empty debates over the relative intrinsic scientific abilities of men and women. One of the more amusing aspects of the discussion was that those who believed in the differences and those who didn’t use the same evidence about gender-specific special ability? How could that be? The answer is that the data shows no substantial effects. Social factors might account for these tiny differences, which in any case have an unclear connection to scientific ability. Not much of a headline when phrased that way, is it? Each type of science has its own source of complexity and potential for miscommunication. Yet there are steps we can take to improve public understanding in all cases. The first would be to inculcate greater understanding and acceptance of indirect scientific evidence. The information from an unmanned space mission is no less legitimate than the information from one in which people are on board.</p><p>This doesn’t mean questioning an interpretation, but it also doesn’t mean equating indirect evidence with blind belief, as people sometimes suggest. Second, we might need different standards for evaluating science with urgent policy implications than research with the purely theoretical value. When scientists say they are not certain about their predictions, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’ve found nothing substantial. It would be better if scientists were more open about the mathematical significance of their results and if the public didn’t treat math as quite so scary; statistics and errors, which tell us the uncertainty in a measurement, give us the tools to evaluate new developments fairly.</p><p>But most important, people have to recognize that science can be complex. If we accept only simple stories, the description will necessarily be distorted. When advances are subtle or complicated, scientists should be willing to go the extra distance to give proper explanations and the public should be more patient about the truth. Even so, some difficulties are unavoidable. Most developments reflect work in progress, so the story is complex because no one yet knows the big picture.</p>\",\"sections\":[{\"sectionTitle\":\"Section 1\",\"sectionInstruction\":\"<p><strong
